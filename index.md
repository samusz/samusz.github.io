# Welcome to Terra Inco Gnito. 

This site will be rambling about how reality mixes far to much whit a dystopic fiction more and more. 

We can't know all that is true. And this one simple fact makes our view of the world distorted. 
Lacking. Wrong. False. 
But our mind can't “bear the thought“ of a lacking knowledge and will always give us an answer. 
-- Or at the least, the feeling we have an answer. --
Even one that is stupid if we think 2 seconds about it.
And this feeling makes our world view in and by itself overconfident.

# Ways our mind turns on us

This is creepy to even think about : our mind is in a brain. This brain is a biological entity that is the product of an evolutionary process and of an embryology process that both are not optimal in their design for logical and clear thinking.

Evolution isn't aimed at our thinking being 'right' or 'correct'; it's aimed at the human race survival at most and this is through the process of reproduction. Simple minds would say that implies we aren't suppose to live past reproduction age, 40 at most. But we'll see it's not that simple and our ability to live up to 80 or 100 yo has some evolutionary impact researchers are now starting to discover/understand. 

Still remains one fact : we are not fit for thinking and the famous quote says it : “Survival of the fittest“ is so wrong.


## Blindspots: limitations of our senses

### **Vision** the actual blindspot, narrow frequency range and it's consequences 

### **Olfaction** A limited number of receptors for an infinity of molecules

### **Touch** When hands and feet are much more sensitive than bottoms and backs

### **Earing** Vibration perception only in a (very) limited frequency 

### **Proprioception** When the self is it's own mostly ignored sense.


## Thinking processes 

1. The Slow / analytic
2. The Fast / intuitive

### Biases that derives from them

## **knowledge**

Limitations on models  and data



## **testimony**

Limitations due to believing testimony over real data study*

## history interpretation from the future fallacy 

### The bias of back propagation (not what it's usually called)

of seeing patterns where there are none, and o course of believing "we/I could have done better".
