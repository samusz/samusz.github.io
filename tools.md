*** tools *** 

This page aims to describe some tools I use, their setups and my overall feeling about them. 

# OS 

Ive tryed a lot of those during the years. 

The usuall ones.
## MacOS
A long time ago, my father was very mac driven for usability and I was a impovement.
I remember playing with Hypercard, a graphical coding tool, this was so cool !  


## Window
Mostly confronted with it when I wanted to play some games or at some work places. It was so buggy. 

## Unixes 

At the faculty college in France, we had acces to a unix mainframe with clients runing linuses or DSBs (can't remember now) 

The GNU/Linux mouvement was a great improvement for accessible budget computing and I've tryed many distros over the years. 

# Shells 

Sh and bash moslty, fish at one point (I couldn't find a fix to be able to use regeps like 'ls *.pdf' so had chose something else as default), and finaly zsh. 
Even had a try at elvish (not yet mature, great idea) .
